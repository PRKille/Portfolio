              </div>
              <p>After graduating high school in 2005 I attended the University of Kansas to pursue a degree in
                Electrical
                Engineering. After my third year attending I realized that was not the path for me and decided to leave
                academia in an attempt to find my calling.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Not long after leaving school I began working in kitchens. It did not take more than a few weeks for me
                to
                realize this work was what I should be doing.</p>

    <p><strong>Some highlights of my career:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="work">Slow Ride Roadhouse</span> where I was often part of the small crew working days with
        bike
        runs of up to three hundred people.</li>
      <li><span class="work">Spints Alehouse</span> was my first real management experience and introduction to
        creating
        specials and controlling inventory.</li>
      <li><span class="work">Interurban</span> helped me refine my mangement and cooking style over my almost six
        years
        of being sous chef.</li>
      <li><span class="work">Palomar</span> was my keystone. Starting from designing the kitchen layout, menu planning
        and design I was able to create a kitchen program that was simultaniously functional, welcoming, and fun to be
        part of.</li>
